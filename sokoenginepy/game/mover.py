class Mover:
    """Implements game rules (on-board movement).

    Supports forward and reverse solving mode.

    **Forward solving mode**

    - pusher is allowed to push single box at the time
    - pusher can't pull boxes
    - pusher can't jump over boxes or walls

    **Reverse solving mode:**

    - pusher is allowed to pull single box at the time

        - if position allows pull that pull is optional (pusher is allowed to
          move without pull even if pull is possible). Default behavior is to
          always pull boxes but that can be changed any time through
          :meth:`Mover.pulls_boxes`

    - pusher can't push boxes
    - pusher is allowed to jump over boxes and walls

        - jumps are allowed only before first pull is done

    - board starts in solved state: positions of boxes and goals are switched

    **History management**

    Mover only stores last performed move in history and it doesn't offer
    redo. Failed moves, undo and non-moves (ie. selecting already selected
    pusher or jumping on same position pusher is already standing on) clear
    undo history.
